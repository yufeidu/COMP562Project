Authors:

Prerequisite:
- Python 3 (tested on Python 3.9)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- openSMILE
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scipy
- Soundfile

Structure:
preprocessor_a.ipynb: Preprocessor script for approach A using openSMILE
preprocessor_b.ipynb: Preprocessor script for approach B using matplotlib
classifier_a.ipynb: Approach A
classifier_b.ipynb: Approach B

NOTE: Since we used commercial music albums to generate the dataset, 
we could not legally distribute the raw audio files. The audio feature
CSV file for approach A and the spectrograms for approach B are both too
large to include in this repository.
