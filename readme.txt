Structure:
preprocessor_a.ipynb: Preprocessor script for approach A using openSMILE
preprocessor_b.ipynb: Preprocessor script for approach B using matplotlib
classifier_a.ipynb: Approach A
classifier_b.ipynb: Approach B

NOTE: Since we used commercial music albums to generate the dataset, 
we could not legally distribute the raw audio files. The audio feature
CSV file for approach A and the spectrograms for approach B are both too
large to include in this repository. Therefore, we uploaded them to
UNC's OneDrive. You would need a UNC account to download them. 

Approach A:
